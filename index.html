    <h1>Causes of Learning Computer Science</h1>
    <p>My cause of learning computer science is that it provides me with a variety
      of jobs and high salaries. When I began to choose my major the first thing I considered
      is the salary and how many choices of jobs could I have if I choose this major. After condering
      all of these factors, I find the one that I like the most. For me, it is important to
      do what I like but more important is the prospect of the major.</p>
    <p>The data below demonstrates a varity of facts of Computer Science. First, it shows that there are many
      computer-science-related jobs, it only lists 30 jobs, but there will be more than that. Thus, it promises a
      wide variety of jobs. Secondly, it shows salaries of each job, so it is a promise for high salary.
      The datasheet also shows that many people of that job has a major in Computer Science or a major related closely
      to computer science. All of these factors combined together outline a prosperous prospecet of Computer Science.</p>
